      "text": "I’ve been a practicing architect (in one way or another) for over 20 years. But “architecture” is notoriously hard to define – there are dozens of “architectures” and “architects” in any large system. Surely these must have a common thread – some way of talking about all these architectures in a common way – but we have to define what that is. "

    {
      "ordinal": 1,
      "text": "What I’ve came to realize – slowly over time – is this fundamental question of what we do is not commonly asked. Most architecture methodologies talk about the how – how to create models, how to document systems – and sometimes the what – whether that’s people, processes and things or entities and relationships – but not the why of architecture. Why is architecture important, why does it have a role to play, and why should it be a part of our project plans."

      "text": "I started thinking a lot about this question a year or so ago. Embarrassingly, after 20 some years of being “an architect” I didn’t have a clean, concise definition of what architecture was. I didn’t have that “elevator pitch” I could use with an executive who asked what I did for the company. I certainly didn’t have an answer for my grandmother at Thanksgiving – at 102 years old, telling her I “made the world a better place through elegant hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility” was about as meaningful as reciting “The Jabberwocky”, and a good deal less satisfying."

    {
      "ordinal": 4,
      "text": "I believe in architecture. I have been an architect most of my adult life, and I firmly believe is is critical to any organization or system of reasonable size. I like to think I can do architecture and be an architect – but I had to face that hard realization that no professional can be successful if it cannot sell itself to others. There had to be a way of explaining what I did, and why what I did was important, to people who hadn’t spend years of their lives studying UML, TOGAF, or any other approach to architecture."

      "text": "I also came to realize that I had to stop thinking like a technologist. The reality is that we are part of a business. I had to articulate what my profession did for the business; how it advanced our corporate mission in a way business people could relate to. The hard reality is that something that is poorly understood is seen as an overhead at best and unnecessary at worst and probably is. If architecture didn’t have a business function to fulfill and fulfill in a unique way that no other part of the business could, then yes, it probably is overhead and probably should be eliminated."
    },

      "text": "I came to the conclusion that architecture controls against \u003ci\u003equality risks to a system\u003c/i\u003e. OK, maybe that’s not much better than “The Jabberwocky”, but it’s a starting point. It does make a couple things clear right off the bat. It makes clear that architecture doesn’t deal with functionality per se. As an architect, I’m not defining what the system does, I am defining how it does it. Functionality – what the customers get for using a system – is the purview of product management. They talk with customers, decide what customers need, and ruthlessly define the timelines against which to deliver those features to the customer – after all, customers are notoriously ADHD and will wander off into the wilderness of competitive products if we don’t constantly keep their attention. We, the architects and engineers, have to deliver those timelines – and make sure we don’t break anything in the process."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 9,
      "text": "It’s the not breaking things that has always fascinated me. It’s one thing to make a program work. It’s another thing completely to make it work relentlessly – every single time the customer makes a request, in a matter of milliseconds, millions of times a day, all while making sure no data is lost, corrupted, or accidentally disclosed. Building and reinforcing our customers’ trust."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 10,
      "text": "This crystallized as the essence of architecture for me. Product management defined what the system did. Engineering make sure it was implemented correctly. Architecture – my long undefined career – made sure the engineers knew what “correctly” meant, thinking of all the details that might go wrong and putting a plan in place to make sure that those conditions didn’t arise or were caught and corrected when they did, so that the customer could have a relentlessly enjoyable experience with the system."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 11,
      "text": "Of course, this definition has at least two problems. First, it could be too ivory tower – on the surface it’s somewhat hard to reconcile architectures like Lambda or Hadoop with “controls against quality risks”. Second, it uses a bunch of words that aren’t obviously defined: control, quality risk, and system. So in order to make this usable, let’s first get precise about these terms. Then we can get back to the question of whether this even makes sense in the first place. If it doesn’t – and, spoiler alert: I think it does – at least we’ll have the satisfaction of defining a couple terms. Defining precise terms is something I’ve always found architects to enjoy."

The more complicated our software and hardware environment gets, the more we need “architecture” and the more we worry about how the parts fit together."

They could be networking, storage and compute equipment in our data centers, colos, or the cloud. The might be brands or subsidiary companies. The types of components determine the type of architecture (application architecture, network and data center architecture, and so forth). But in all cases we need a collection of connected, interoperating components in order to make architecture interesting; if your application can be written in a single Python module you might not have to think much about architecture at all."

Whether that’s routing data packets to processing units, or providing a merchant with a means to obtain checkout services, or just entertaining a kid by ringing bells with balls moving on wire tracks, the system needs to work toward a common goal. Just having a random collection of disconnected components doesn’t cut it – there needs to be some sense of order and purpose and integration between the components as well."

      "ordinal": 18,
      "text": "“Quality Risk” is a bit trickier. What is ”quality” in the first place? “Quality” has a couple meanings in English; it can be “the degree of excellence of something” – how good or bad that something is when compared to other things of a similar kind. It can also be “a distinct attribute or characteristic” – for example, a leadership quality or that “indescribable quality that makes someone a star”. Of these definitions, we’re talking about the former: a measurement of how well something measures against a stated objective. It’s confusing because we sometimes talk about the “system qualities” meaning the second definition, as opposed to the “system quality” meaning the first. English is lovely sometimes."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 19,
      "text": "It’s important to notice that this almost always means a non-functional characteristic of a system. We don’t really speak about how well a system measures against the stated business objective; it either meets the objective, or it doesn’t. We can build an absolutely fabulous system for selling buggy whips, and probably still have a business failure even though the system quality was very high. This goes back to the discussion on product owners; they have to make sure that someone really wants the system in the first place. Our job as architects is to make sure it’s high quality if they do."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 20,
      "text": "We’ll talk more about this another time, but architecture quality can’t be subjective. “Quality” isn’t like “beauty”; it can’t be in the eye of the beholder. We need some way of specifying what our quality target is in clear, objective language. Something like “we will respond to the user within 300ms”. That’s pretty clear, and easy to measure. It also doesn’t say anything about how secure our response will be, or how much it will cost us to make that response. So we’ll have to have targets for those as well, and a dozen other things that make up the quality of our system."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 21,
      "text": "The risk, then is that we state we’ll make a certain measure and not actually make is. Maybe we respond in 301ms instead – not such a big deal. 3000ms, on the hand, could be and 30000ms definitely is. A quality risk, then is the risk that we might not make the target or, more precisely, that we’ll miss the target by a noticeable amount. That’s really what architecture focuses on; risks that systems won’t meet non-functional targets by a noticeable amount."

    },
    {
      "ordinal": 23,
      "text": "That brings us to “control”. Since we’re taking about quality risks, it makes sense to talk about “control” in the language of risk management. A control in risk management lingo is “the policy or procedure by which potential risks are evaluated, reduced, or eliminated”. Controls are born out of thinking about what could go wrong, planning for what to do if they do go wrong, and planning on how to prevent them from going wrong in the first place."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 24,
      "text": "You’ll hear architects talking about the ”guardrails” of a system. That’s basically an informal way of saying ”control”. By putting in place a guardrail – which is to say by specifying a policy or procedures that we expect to be followed – we are creating an expectation of how the system will be designed in order to meet a set of quality goals. The controls don’t tell us exactly how to write a system, but they do keep us within a certain set of safe boundaries. A guardrail doesn’t tell us how to drive; it just tells us that straying too far from a certain path could be dangerous."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 25,
      "text": "Note also that the controls don’t say anything about what the system does. Guardrails keep you on the road, but don’t tell you where you’re going, or why you want to be there. Again the distinction between product management, and architecture."
    },
    {
      "ordinal": 26,
      "text": "So now we can go back to the definition. Architecture is the result of someone thinking about what the desired characteristics of a system are, how to set a target for those characteristics, how to measure the actual system performance, and what policies and procedures to put in place to make achieving the target as likely as possible. We call those targets SLAs; we call those policies and procedures ”architecture”, and we call that someone an architect."
