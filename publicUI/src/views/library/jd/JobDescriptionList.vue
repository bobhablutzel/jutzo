  One of the challenges you frequently have in standing up an architecture team is how to
  describe the various different roles that you will need to hire for. The descriptions below
    are intended to give a starting point for that.
  </p>
  <p>It's important to keep a few things in mind while looking at these job descriptions. First,
  these are not intended to be a cut-and-paste into your talent acquisition system. There will be
  a number of tweaks and edits that have to occur; if nothing else you will need to add your
  company name and the inevitable boilerplate that comes from talent acquisition. These are more
  designed to be a model and checklist for things that you should consider during the process.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>Please be mindful of the language that you use in creating job descriptions, especially
    language around minimum requirements. Studies have shown that under-represented populations
    have a tendency to self-select out of jobs they can be highly successful in due to an
    overly prescriptive set of qualifications. You should carefully apply the MUST/SHOULD/MAY model
    to the qualifications you list in order to avoid potentially discouraging high value candidates.</p>

    <li><router-link :to="{ name: 'ChiefArchitectJD'}">Chief Architect</router-link>
