    The Chief Architect is the key role for the organization. In most organizations, the Chief Architect
    has both the responsibility of being the most experienced architect in the organization, and also
    in managing the team of architects. This dual role requires a mix of people leadership and architectural
    capabilities that can be hard to find.</p>
  <p>Of course, there are exceptions. Some organizations hire a pure people leader for the Chief Architect
    role, and others keep the role as an individual contributor. In general, both of these are compromises.
    Decoupling the Chief Architect and the people leadership role creates an organization with two heads - the
    managerial and the architectural. This confuses the reporting structure and violates the general principle
    of having a single person in charge of a given organization. It's generally more effective to leverage the

    to create a small leadership team
    that the Chief Architect can manage without management doesn't become the overriding part of their daily
    activities. This is particularly important in organizations with highly structured HR processes.
  </p>
  <p>The job description below can be scaled for an overall enterprise, a line of business, or a smaller
    engineering organization. In doing so, it's important to recognize which capabilities are delegated down
    to the level being hired for, and clarify the roles and responsibilities as part of the editing of this
    job description. Failing to do this creates a misalignment between expectations and actual autonomy once
    the candidate joins the organization.</p>
  <p>As with all other job descriptions, this will have to be edited to align with the talent acquisition
    standards at your organization. In particular, you will have to include whether this individual will
    report to the CTO, CIO, Head of Engineering, or another role in the company; how large an organization
    this individual will manage; whether there will be a matrix relationship with other architects; and the
    level of the role (senior executive, executive, director, etc.).</p>

    <h1>Chief Architect</h1>
    <p><i>Our Company</i> is searching for a Chief Architect to lead the overall architecture practices for
    the organization. The successful candidate will report to the Chief Technology Officer and be
      a key member of our technical leadership team. In this role, you will be responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Establishing a set of scalable practices and procedures for architecture;</li>
      <li>Defining a set of architectural standards and patterns;</li>
      <li>Implementing a set of example best practice artifacts;</li>
      <li>Managing a team of senior architects; </li>
      <li>Tracking and introducing emerging technology trends;</li>
      <li>Impartially resolve technology disputes;</li>
      <li>Advise and evaluate engineering teams on architectural standards; and</li>
      <li>Ensure technology aligns with business strategy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The role of the architect is to ensure that the engineering organization is
    working within a clearly defined set of constraints that align with the strategic
    goals of the company. These constraints will include both technical constraints
    (frameworks, environments, configurations, operating procedures, etc.) and business
    constraints (strategic alignment, buy/build evaluations, organizational models, etc.).
    The role is also partner to, but not a part of, the business, product, and engineering teams.
    These characteristics of the role suggest that the successful candidate will have both
    broad technical experience, an understanding of the business, and the ability to
    present, negotiate, and build consensus with a variety of stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>While this role is the final authority for architectural decisions, including whether
    an engineering initiative is aligned with architectural guidance, the individual in this
    role cannot become a bottleneck. In light of this, the successful candidate will also
    need to build a trusted team, provide that team with a vision and direction, and then
    delegate responsibilities to that team in a structured way. This delegation will need to
    be properly documented so that the overall organization understand who to engage when.</p>
    <p>This role will have accountability for the adherence to architectural guidelines. In
    light of this, the successful candidate is expected to understand how to communicate those
    guidelines in a way that they can be quickly adopted by engineering communities. This may
    include any of written architectural standards, architectural models and diagrams, and example
    code. The expectation of the role is not that the candidate independently develop these assets,
    but rather that they can both build a team and leverage the existing engineering organization
    in order to create them.</p>
    <p>In light of the accountability to architectural adherence, this role will also participate
    in periodic audit activities with internal audit, external regulators, and others.</p>
    <p>The successful candidate will be taking over an existing architecture team of X individuals, with
    an expectation of growing that team over time. The successful candidate will also need to
    evaluate the incumbents on the team, define the go-forward skill and talent expectations, and
    manage the team appropriately.</p>
